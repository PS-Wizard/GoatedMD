First day of starting this, lets do a little bit of requirement gathering. Things I want:

- A robust template like feel that can go with anything; documentation, journals, homework ... just the full 9 yards
- Latest Mermaid support
     - The thing I am using now, is an older version of mermaid; which is annoying as there are newer diagrams available.
- Chart.js Support
    - I like the idea of being able to make graphs easily. 
- Vercel's Design Language 
    - Support for icons from [Icons](https://vercel.com/geist/icons)
    - Support for tags / badges [Badges](https://vercel.com/geist/badge)
    - Code Blocks
        - Code Syntax Highlighting.
        - Design: [Code Block Design](https://vercel.com/geist/code-block)
        - Need the Copy Button. 
        - Need the line numbers.
        - Code Snippets [Vercel's Code Snippets](https://vercel.com/geist/snippet)
